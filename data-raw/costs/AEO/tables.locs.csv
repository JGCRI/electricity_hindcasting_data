2011,8.2,Cost and Performance Characteristics of New Central Station Electricity Generating Technologies,97,"eia commissioned external consultant to develop current cost estimates for utility-scale electric generating plants. Overnight costs in 8.2 represent estimated cost of building a plant in a typical region of the country. Regional variations account for multiple factors, such as difference si nterrain, weather, population, and labor wages. The base overnight cost is multiplied by a project contingency factor and a technological optimism factor (described later in this chapter), resulting in the total construction cost for the first-of-a-kind unit used for the capacity choice decision."
